# Rocket Boost

A physics-based arcade game built in **Unity**, where the player controls a rocket and navigates through obstacles to reach the goal.

This project was created to learn core gameplay programming concepts such as physics-based movement, collision handling, and level progression.

---

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview
- Control a rocket using thrust and rotation
- Avoid obstacles and hazards
- Reach the finish platform to complete levels
- Restart on collision or failure

---

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Rigidbody-based movement and forces
- Input handling and player control
- Collision detection and response
- Basic game state flow (play, crash, level complete)
- Structuring simple gameplay logic in Unity

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Unity
- C#

---

## 📌 Current Status
🔧 **Refactoring planned**

This project is being refactored to:
- Improve separation of responsibilities
- Introduce cleaner gameplay architecture
- Make systems more scalable and maintainable

This refactor will serve as a gameplay systems case study for my portfolio.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- State machine for game flow
- Data-driven configuration using ScriptableObjects
- Event-based communication
- Gameplay polish (camera, feedback, effects)
